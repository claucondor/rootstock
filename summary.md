# Contract Generator API Integration Updates

## Overview

We've successfully updated the frontend components to work with the new API structure, where instead of the `/generate` endpoint returning documentation and diagram data in a single response, these have been moved to separate endpoints (`/generate/documentation` and `/generate/diagram`). This change improves user experience by making initial contract generation faster, then asynchronously fetching documentation and diagram data.

## Changes Made

1. **ChatInterface.tsx**:
   - Added new state variables for tracking documentation and diagram loading states
   - Implemented `fetchDocumentation` and `fetchDiagram` functions to call the new API endpoints
   - Added an `onLoadingStateChange` prop to notify parent components of loading state changes
   - Updated the contract saving logic to initially save without analysis data, then update it when documentation/diagram data is received

2. **ContractVisualizer.tsx**:
   - Added loading state prop to display a loading indicator while diagram data is being generated
   - Added visual feedback for users while waiting for the diagram

3. **FunctionDocumentation.tsx**:
   - Added loading state prop to display a loading indicator while documentation is being generated
   - Updated to parse function descriptions from contract analysis data
   - Improved UI to show a loading state

4. **DiagramView.tsx**:
   - Added loading state indicators for better user feedback
   - Updated to handle loading state from parent component

5. **ContractGenerator.tsx** (main page):
   - Added state variables to track documentation and diagram loading states
   - Added a handler to receive loading state updates from the ChatInterface component
   - Updated to pass loading states to respective components

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**:
   - The initial contract generation is faster since it no longer waits for documentation and diagram data
   - Users see the contract code immediately, while documentation and diagrams load in the background
   - Clear loading indicators inform users when additional data is being generated

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Separate API calls for documentation and diagrams allow for more granular error handling
   - If one feature fails (e.g., diagram generation), the rest of the application still works

3. **More Maintainable Code**:
   - Each component now handles its own loading state
   - The separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend

## Next Steps

The code is now ready to handle the updated API structure. When deploying these changes, ensure that:

1. The backend API endpoints are properly configured and responding as expected
2. The environment variables for API URLs are set correctly
3. Test all the features to ensure they work as expected with the new asynchronous loading approach
