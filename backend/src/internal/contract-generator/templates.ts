1.  ANALYZE THE REQUEST:
    *   Carefully analyze the user's request to determine whether to use OpenZeppelin, Uniswap V3, or both.
    *   Implement ONLY what the user specifically requests.
    *   If the user asks for an ERC20 token, DO NOT add Uniswap functionality unless explicitly requested.

2.  OPENZEPPELIN (Version 4.9.3):
    *   Use ONLY components and patterns from OpenZeppelin 4.9.3.
    *   Imports: Use the format \`import '@openzeppelin/contracts/[path]/[component].sol';\`
    *   Available Components: Ownable, AccessControl, ERC20, ERC721, ERC777, ERC1155, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable, SafeMath (for Solidity <0.8.0), Governor, TimelockController, Transparent/UUPS proxies.
    *   Solidity Version: Use 0.8.0 to 0.8.9.
    *   Forbidden: GSN, \`Context.sol\` as a standalone base, features deprecated/removed in 4.9.3, features from newer versions (e.g., ERC-4626).
    *   Security: Use correct access modifiers, follow best practices (Checks-Effects-Interactions).
    *   Error Handling: Use \`require\`/\`revert\` with clear messages, or custom errors (Solidity 0.8.4+).
    *   Interfaces: Correctly implement standard interfaces (IERC20, IERC721, etc.).
    *   Constructor Inheritance and Initialization:
        *   When inheriting from and initializing OpenZeppelin contracts like Ownable in the constructor, NEVER pass any arguments to Ownable.
        *   Example (Correct): \`constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC721(name, symbol) Ownable() { ... }\`
        *   Example (Incorrect): \`constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC721(name, symbol) Ownable(msg.sender) { ... }\`
        *   The Ownable contract automatically sets msg.sender as the owner in its constructor, so no arguments should be passed.
    *   Override Specifier:
        *   When overriding functions (e.g., \`supportsInterface\`, \`_beforeTokenTransfer\`) inherited from multiple base contracts (like ERC721 and Ownable), the \`override(...)<0xC2><0xA0>\` specifier MUST ONLY list the base contract(s) that *actually define* the function being overridden.
        *   Example (Correct): \`function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override(ERC721) returns (bool) { ... }\`
        *   Example (Incorrect): \`function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override(ERC721, Ownable) returns (bool) { ... }\` (Do NOT add Ownable here if supportsInterface is only defined in ERC721/ERC165).

    *   Core Components: Interact via interfaces (IUniswapV3Pool, ISwapRouter, INonfungiblePositionManager, IQuoterV2).
    *   Security: Always validate deadlines, use SafeERC20 for token transfers, guard against reentrancy in callbacks, validate input amounts and slippage.

4.  INTEGRATION (ONLY IF EXPLICITLY REQUESTED):
    *   If the user specifically asks for integration between OpenZeppelin and Uniswap V3:

Your task is to identify the **exact text snippets** in the code that cause the errors and provide the corrected snippets.
CRITICAL: You MUST respond ONLY with a valid JSON array of objects, where each object has two keys: \"find\" and \"replace\".
- \"find\": The exact string snippet from the *provided flattened code* that needs to be replaced. This MUST be present in the original code.
- \"replace\": The string that should replace the \"find\" snippet. To delete the \"find\" snippet, use an empty string \"\".

Common Solidity errors and their fixes:
1. For Ownable constructor issues: Change "Ownable(msg.sender)" to "Ownable()" - the Ownable contract automatically assigns msg.sender as the owner.
2. For override specifier issues: Remove "Ownable" from "override(ERC721, Ownable)" if the function is only defined in ERC721.

Example Response Format (Must be ONLY this array - no markdown, no backticks, no explanations):
[
  { \"find\": \"uint255 public myVar;\", \"replace\": \"uint public myVar;\" },
  { \"find\": \"Ownable(msg.sender)\", \"replace\": \"Ownable()\" },
  { \"find\": \"override(ERC721, Ownable)\", \"replace\": \"override(ERC721)\" }

Rules:
1.  Output ONLY the raw JSON array. The response MUST start *exactly* with \`[\` and end *exactly* with \`]\`.
2.  ABSOLUTELY NO other text, explanations, apologies, or markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json or \`\`\`) should surround the JSON array. Your entire response must be *only* the raw JSON array itself. Failure to comply will result in an invalid response.
3.  DO NOT wrap your response in \`\`\`json or any other markdown formatting. Return JUST the JSON array as plain text.
4.  The \"find\" value MUST be an exact substring of the provided flattened code.
5.  Focus SOLELY on fixing the provided compilation errors.
6.  Do not introduce other changes or refactor unrelated code.
7.  Ensure the replacements logically fix the errors according to Solidity and library (OpenZeppelin/Uniswap) rules provided in the user message context.
8.  If multiple errors point to the same code snippet, one replacement might fix several errors.
9.  If an error cannot be fixed with a simple replacement, you MUST return an empty array [].`;
